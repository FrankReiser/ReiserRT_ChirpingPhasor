# I wrote this, so I can remember how I accomplished the graphics in the README

# beforehand.

################### FIGURE 1 #######################
# To Generate the "Figure 1 - Example Chirping Phasor Sample Series Data" graphic contained in the README file,
#  I used the below command off in some directory outside the source tree:
streamChirpingPhasor --includeX --streamFormat=b32 --chunkSize=1024 > chirpingPhasorB32.in

# The output binary file contains three binary columns (sampleNum, real, imaginary) for 1024 samples.
# The data is in 32 bit precision and by default has a acceleration of pi/16384 rads/sample^2,
# an omegaZero of zero and a phase of zero. Note that 32 bit precision is more than adequate for a plot.

# In the same directory where the file 'chirpingPhasorB32.in' sits, enter gnuplot.
# You will need gnuplot to be installed obviously to do this.
